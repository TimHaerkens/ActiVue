# ActiVue

Are you bored? No worries, we've got you covered!

## Bored API

Using the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/) you can easily get a suggestion on a fun activity to do.
The API lets you ask for an activity based on a request with optional parameters (price, participants).
It will respond with an activity with a description, type, participants, price, link (if available), a unique key and accessibility.

## Filters

At the moment, two filters can be used to narrow down your search:

1. Participants: Select with how many people you want to do an activity with one being alone.
    
2. Price: Select a minimum price and a maximum price with 0 being costless and 5 euro signs being very expensive

## Like / Dislike

On an activity you can press the 'heart' icon to like an activity and it will be added to your favorites page.
You can also press 'NOT HAPPY' and it will be added to your dislikes. A disliked activity will still be shown but it might be an idea to disable disliked activities.

## Favorites

If you click the username in the top right corner you can click on MY FAVORITES to go to the favorites page and see which activities you pressed LIKE on.

## And that's it!

Enjoy this little app and go do some cool stuff!
